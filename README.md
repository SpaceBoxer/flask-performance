### Flask-Performance

A Flask extension to monitoring every **REAL** api request and collect it's performance in **REAL**-time.‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®


The world is powered by APIs. But how API works, are they work as expected? are they handle request fast enough? we don't know actually at most time.

That's why we need a more deeper monitor about APIs. And here we are to solve this prolem.


#### 1„ÄÅInstall by pip

> pip install flask-performance

#### 2„ÄÅGenerate DSN

Go to https://status.spacebox.fun, sign up  or login. Create a new project or new team (if you are working in a company, we highly recommend you create Team first and put every project into the Team afterward)

And after suceccfully create a project, you are given a DSN url, which is the API your project performance data will send to.

e.g.

> https://metrics.spacebox.fun/v1/collector/c5b35bc078844a59a15dd506e08f3ae6


#### 3„ÄÅSetup & configuration in your Flask project

```python

from flask import Flask
from flask_performance import PerformanceCollector

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['METRIC_DSN'] = 'https://metrics.spacebox.fun/v1/collector/c5b35bc078844a59a15dd506e08f3ae6'

pc = PerformanceCollector(app)

# or by init_app() when you use factory pattern to creat flask app
app = create_app()
app.config['METRIC_DSN'] = 'https://metrics.spacebox.fun/v1/collector/c5b35bc078844a59a15dd506e08f3ae6'

pc = PerformanceCollector()
pc.init_app(app)

```

You can also put **METRIC_DSN** into your project `config.py` file and use Flask's `from_pyfile`.


in your `config.py` file

> METRIC_DSN = 'https://metrics.spacebox.fun/v1/collector/c5b35bc078844a59a15dd506e08f3ae6'

in your project `app.py` file

> app.from_pyfile('config')


**And, That's ALL**, just go to your https://status.spacebox.fun platform to check your project all API performance in real-time.


#### 4„ÄÅPerformance problem

Chance is that you will ask: Will this performance collector affect your project's performance ?

the short answer is: yes.

**BUT**, the affects is limit maximus to `500ms`. We set the timeout to `500ms` when send the performance data to the API.

And we implemented this API in a asynchronous way, which means when we receive your project performance data every time we will response immediately and throw the save performance data task to a task queue (which is Celery). In most case, the API will reponse under 100ms.
